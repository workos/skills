## WorkOS Skills

This repository contains 39 AI agent skills for implementing WorkOS features.

### Getting Started

For any WorkOS task, start with the router skill at `skills/workos/SKILL.md`. It maps user intent to the right skill file.

### Skill Categories

- **AuthKit** (6 skills): Framework-specific auth integration — Next.js, React, React Router, TanStack Start, vanilla JS
- **Features** (11 skills): SSO, Directory Sync, RBAC, Vault, Events, Audit Logs, Admin Portal, MFA, Custom Domains, Email, Widgets
- **Migrations** (10 skills): Auth0, Firebase, Clerk, AWS Cognito, Stytch, Supabase, Descope, Better Auth, standalone SSO, other services
- **API References** (10 skills): Per-domain API endpoint guides
- **Routers** (2 skills): Master dispatcher + integrations provider lookup

### How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and structured markdown. Skills encode procedural knowledge — numbered steps, decision trees, verification commands, error recovery. They reference WorkOS doc URLs for runtime fetching rather than embedding documentation.

### Development

```bash
bun run generate                       # generate (skips unchanged skills)
bun run generate -- --force            # force regenerate all
bun run scripts/refine-batch.ts        # AI-refine skills (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
bun run scripts/build-plugin-manifests.ts  # regenerate plugin.json files
bun test                               # run tests
```
