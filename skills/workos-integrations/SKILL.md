# WorkOS Integrations

## Step 1: Identify the Provider

Ask the user which identity provider they need to integrate. Then find it in the table below.

## Step 2: Set Up the Connection

**WebFetch** the provider-specific doc URL from the table above, then follow the protocol for the connection type.

### SAML SSO Setup

1. In WorkOS Dashboard, navigate to **Organizations > [Org] > Authentication**
2. Click **Add Connection** and select SAML
3. Copy these values from the connection detail page:
   - **ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service) — paste into IdP's SSO config
   - **SP Entity ID** — paste into IdP's audience/entity field
4. In the IdP admin console, create a new SAML application:
   a. Set the ACS URL and SP Entity ID from step 3
   b. Configure attribute mapping: `id` → NameID, `email` → email, `firstName` → first name, `lastName` → last name
   c. Download or copy the **IdP Metadata URL** (or download the metadata XML file)
5. Back in WorkOS Dashboard, upload the IdP metadata (URL or XML file)
6. Connection state transitions: **Draft → Validating → Active**
   - If it stays in Draft, see Troubleshooting below

### SCIM Directory Sync Setup

1. In WorkOS Dashboard, navigate to **Organizations > [Org] > Directory Sync**
2. Click **Add Directory** and select the provider
3. Copy these values from the directory detail page:
   - **SCIM Endpoint URL** (e.g., `https://api.workos.com/directories/<DIR_ID>/scim/v2`)
   - **SCIM Bearer Token** — treat as a secret, never log or commit
4. In the IdP admin console, configure SCIM provisioning:
   a. Set the SCIM Base URL to the endpoint from step 3
   b. Set Authentication to **Bearer Token** and paste the token
   c. Enable provisioning actions: Create Users, Update User Attributes, Deactivate Users
   d. Map user attributes: `userName` → email, `name.givenName` → first name, `name.familyName` → last name
5. Run a test push/sync from the IdP to verify users appear in WorkOS
6. Directory state transitions: **Inactive → Validating → Linked**

### OAuth Social Login Setup

1. In the OAuth provider's developer console, create a new OAuth application
2. Set the **Redirect URI** to the value from WorkOS Dashboard:
   - Format: `https://auth.workos.com/sso/oauth/callback/<CONNECTION_ID>`
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the provider
4. In WorkOS Dashboard, navigate to **Authentication > Social Login**
5. Select the provider and paste the Client ID and Client Secret
6. Configure scopes (typically: `openid`, `profile`, `email`)
7. Test by initiating a login flow through your application

## Step 3: Verify the Integration

```bash
# Check connection status via WorkOS API
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKOS_API_KEY" \
  https://api.workos.com/connections | jq '.data[] | {id, name, state}'

# Verify SSO connection is active
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKOS_API_KEY" \
  https://api.workos.com/connections | jq '.data[] | select(.state == "active") | .name'

# Check directory sync connections
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKOS_API_KEY" \
  https://api.workos.com/directories | jq '.data[] | {id, name, state}'
```

Checklist:
- [ ] Connection appears in WorkOS Dashboard with "Active" (SSO) or "Linked" (directory) state
- [ ] Test SSO login succeeds with a test user
- [ ] User profile attributes map correctly (email, first name, last name, groups)
- [ ] (If SCIM) Directory sync shows users from provider
- [ ] (If OAuth) Social login redirects correctly and returns user profile

## Integration Type Decision Tree

```
What type of integration?
  |
  +-- SSO (user login)
  |     |
  |     +-- Provider supports SAML? → Use SAML connection (preferred for enterprise)
  |     +-- Provider supports OIDC only? → Use OIDC connection
  |     +-- Provider supports both? → Prefer SAML (wider enterprise support, more attributes)
  |
  +-- Directory Sync (user provisioning)
  |     |
  |     +-- Provider supports SCIM? → Use SCIM connection
  |     +-- No SCIM but has API? → Check if WorkOS has a native directory for this provider
  |     +-- No directory support? → Consider SFTP-based import or manual sync
  |
  +-- OAuth (social login)
        |
        +-- Find provider in OAuth section of table above
        +-- Follow OAuth setup steps in Step 2
```

## Troubleshooting Decision Tree

```
Connection not working?
  |
  +-- Connection stuck in "Draft"
  |     |
  |     +-- Did you upload IdP metadata? → Upload XML or enter metadata URL in Dashboard
  |     +-- Metadata uploaded but still Draft? → Check metadata is valid XML, not HTML login page
  |     +-- Using metadata URL? → Verify URL is publicly reachable (not behind firewall)
  |
  +-- Connection stuck in "Validating"
  |     |
  |     +-- IdP metadata certificate expired? → Upload new cert or fresh metadata
  |     +-- ACS URL contains typo? → Re-copy from Dashboard, paste exactly
  |     +-- SP Entity ID mismatch? → Ensure IdP audience matches WorkOS SP Entity ID exactly
  |
  +-- SAML assertion errors
  |     |
  |     +-- "Recipient mismatch" → ACS URL in IdP config does not match WorkOS; re-copy it
  |     +-- "Audience mismatch" → SP Entity ID in IdP does not match; re-copy it
  |     +-- "Signature invalid" → IdP metadata/certificate is stale; re-upload current metadata
  |     +-- "Response expired" → Clock skew between IdP and SP; verify NTP sync on IdP server
  |     +-- "NameID missing" → IdP not sending NameID; add NameID mapping in IdP attribute config
  |
  +-- SCIM sync failing
  |     |
  |     +-- 401 Unauthorized → Bearer token is wrong or expired; regenerate in Dashboard
  |     +-- 404 Not Found → SCIM endpoint URL is wrong; re-copy from Dashboard
  |     +-- Users sync but no attributes → Check attribute mapping in IdP; must map userName, name.*
  |     +-- Users created but not updated → Ensure "Update User Attributes" is enabled in IdP provisioning
  |     +-- Deactivated users still active → Enable "Deactivate Users" in IdP provisioning settings
  |
  +-- OAuth redirect errors
  |     |
  |     +-- "redirect_uri_mismatch" → Redirect URI in provider console doesn't match WorkOS; copy exact URI
  |     +-- "invalid_client" → Client ID or Secret is wrong; re-copy from provider console
  |     +-- "access_denied" → User denied consent, or OAuth app not approved; check provider app status
  |     +-- Scopes error → Remove unsupported scopes; start with openid, profile, email
  |
  +-- "Organization not found"
        |
        +-- No org exists → Create organization in Dashboard first
        +-- Org exists but connection not linked → Link connection to organization in Dashboard
        +-- Domain not verified → Verify domain under Organizations > Domains (required for SSO)
```

## Error Recovery Reference

| Problem | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Connection stuck in "Draft" | IdP metadata not uploaded or invalid | Upload valid IdP metadata XML or enter a reachable metadata URL in Dashboard |
| Connection stuck in "Validating" | Certificate expired or ACS/Entity ID mismatch | Re-upload fresh metadata; verify ACS URL and SP Entity ID match exactly |
| SAML "Recipient mismatch" | ACS URL in IdP does not match WorkOS value | Copy exact ACS URL from WorkOS Dashboard > Connection > Details |
| SAML "Audience mismatch" | SP Entity ID in IdP does not match WorkOS | Copy exact SP Entity ID from Dashboard; paste into IdP audience/entity field |
| SAML "Signature invalid" | IdP certificate rotated but WorkOS has old cert | Re-download IdP metadata and re-upload to WorkOS Dashboard |
| SAML "Response expired" | Clock skew between IdP server and WorkOS | Sync IdP server time via NTP; most assertions allow 5-minute skew |
| SCIM 401 Unauthorized | Bearer token is expired or was regenerated | Copy current token from Dashboard > Directory > SCIM Config |
| SCIM 404 Not Found | Endpoint URL has wrong directory ID or path | Re-copy full SCIM endpoint URL from Dashboard |
| SCIM sync no attributes | Attribute mapping missing in IdP | Map userName, name.givenName, name.familyName in IdP SCIM config |
| SCIM users not deactivated | Deprovisioning not enabled | Enable "Deactivate Users" in IdP provisioning settings |
| OAuth "redirect_uri_mismatch" | Redirect URI in provider console is different | Paste exact redirect URI from WorkOS Dashboard into provider OAuth app |
| OAuth "invalid_client" | Client ID or Secret is wrong | Re-copy Client ID and Secret from provider developer console |
| "Organization not found" | Connection not linked to an organization | Create org in Dashboard, then link the connection to it |
| "Domain not verified" | SSO requires a verified domain | Go to Organizations > Domains, add and verify the domain |
